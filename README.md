- 👋 Hi, I’m @vizkeletibala
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks, Web-Development, DevOps and Video Games. I guess I'm still searching for the one...
- 🌱 I graduated from ELTE Faculty of Informatics in 2024 with a Bachelor of Computer Science Degree (details coming soon)...
- I've been working for Loxon Solutions Zrt. for over a year, as a DevOps Engineer, where I helped software developer teams deliver Risk Analysis, Collection and Early Warning System products to over 60 banks across the world.
- I'm also starting a solo entreprenaurial journey, where I aim to deliver fast and reliable Docker and monitoring solutions for small startups and teams. My goal is to help small software businesses scale easier and faster. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning Systems and DevOps infrastructures.
